# One can observe that classes contain properties and that objects are created to manipulate and access these properties. 
# To make this object-oriented system more reliable and error free, it is a good practice to limit access to the class members at times.
# Information hiding refers to the concept of hiding the inner workings of a class and simply providing an interface through which the outside world can interact with the class without knowing whatâ€™s going on inside.
# The purpose is to implement classes in such a way that the instances (objects) of these classes should not be able to cause any unauthorized access or change in the original contents of a class. 
# One class does not need to know anything about the underlying algorithms of another class. However, the two can still communicate.


# Data hiding can be divided into two primary components:

# Encapsulation
# Abstraction
# Encapsulation in OOP refers to binding data and the methods to manipulate that data together in a single unit, that is, class.
# ncapsulation is usually done to hide the state and representation of an object from outside. 
# A good way is to make all variables in a class private to restrict access by the rest of the code to that class
# Once you do this you need to create public methods that can communictae with that class. These methods are called getters and setters. 

# ADVANTAGES OF ENCAPSULATION

# Classes make the code easy to change and maintain.
# Properties to be hidden can be specified easily.
# We decide which outside classes or functions can access the class properties.

# GETTERS AND SETTERS
# A getter method allows you to read a property's value
# A setter method allows you to modify a property's value
